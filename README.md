Don't use this, I'm on Codeberg now: [https://codeberg.org/blopes](url)

# flap
Flappy Bird clone written in C with Raylib, in a neat 180 lines of code

# Compilation
## Dependencies
This depends on raylib. The makefile uses cproc as the default compiler.
## Building
Simply run `make` in the game's directory. If you don't want to go through the hassle of installing cproc, you can instead run `make CC=<compiler>` to use another compiler.

# Running
Enter `./flap` after compiling and the game will pop up.

# Notes
As of now, this doesn't run on anything other than Linux OSes.
